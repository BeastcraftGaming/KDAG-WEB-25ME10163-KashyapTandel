Hello, My name is Kashyap Tandel. I'm a first year undergraduate student of mechanical engineering enrolled in it's btech course. I'm a boarder of Lal Bahadur Shastri Hall Of Residence. I'm from Surat Gujarat.

Had a lot of fun working on this project, almost gave an entire day on it. Due to other work I was only able to start working on this on saturday. last time I had done HTML, CSS, Javascript was in lockdown which was 4 years ago. So it was almost a fresh start.

Had learnt javascript for mask task but it was only backend in nodejs.

I had made the quiz system so that it is easy to implement multiple answer questions in future if needed. I wasn't able to implement a countdown timer due to time constraints.

note: no AI was used in making the javascript code. But had to take a lot of help from google and chatgpt for CSS as I didn't had time to learn it. And I will ensure that I will acquire that skill too once I get time.
